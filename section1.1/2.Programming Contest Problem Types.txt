	    	*Programming Contest Problem Types *

Hal Burch conducted an analysis over spring break of 1999 and made an
amazing discovery: there are only 16 types of programming contest
problems! Furthermore, the top several comprise almost 80% of the
problems seen at the IOI. Here they are:

  * Dynamic Programming
  * Greedy
  * Complete Search
  * Flood Fill
  * Shortest Path
  * Recursive Search Techniques
  * Minimum Spanning Tree
  * Knapsack
  * Computational Geometry
  * Network Flow
  * Eulerian Path
  * Two-Dimensional Convex Hull
  * BigNums
  * Heuristic Search
  * Approximate Search
  * Ad Hoc Problems

The most challenging problems are Combination Problems which involve a
loop (combinations, subsets, etc.) around one of the above algorithms -
or even a loop of one algorithm with another inside it. These seem
extraordinarily tricky to get right, even though conceptually they are
``obvious''.

If you can master solving just 40% of these problem types, you can
almost guarantee a silver medal at the IOI. Mastering 80% moves you into
the gold range almost for sure. Of course, `mastery' is a tough nut to
crack! We'll be supplying a plethora of problems so that you can hone
your skills in the quest for international fame.
