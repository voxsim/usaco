  Mixing Milk

Since milk packaging is such a low margin business, it is important to
keep the price of the raw product (milk) as low as possible. Help Merry
Milk Makers get the milk they need in the cheapest possible manner.

The Merry Milk Makers company has several farmers from which they may
buy milk, and each one has a (potentially) different price at which they
sell to the milk packing plant. Moreover, as a cow can only produce so
much milk a day, the farmers only have so much milk to sell per day.
Each day, Merry Milk Makers can purchase an integral amount of milk from
each farmer, less than or equal to the farmer's limit.

Given the Merry Milk Makers' daily requirement of milk, along with the
cost per gallon and amount of available milk for each farmer, calculate
the minimum amount of money that it takes to fulfill the Merry Milk
Makers' requirements.

Note: The total milk produced per day by the farmers will be sufficient
to meet the demands of the Merry Milk Makers.


      PROGRAM NAME: milk


      INPUT FORMAT

Line 1: 	Two integers, N and M.
The first value, N, (0 <= N <= 2,000,000) is the amount of milk that
Merry Milk Makers wants per day. The second, M, (0 <= M <= 5,000) is the
number of farmers that they may buy from.
Lines 2 through M+1: 	The next M lines each contain two integers, P_i
and A_i .
P_i (0 <= P_i <= 1,000) is price in cents that farmer i charges.
A_i (0 <= Ai <= 2,000,000) is the amount of milk that farmer i can sell
to Merry Milk Makers per day.
