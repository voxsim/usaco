        Representing Binary Numbers

Computers operate on 1's and 0's; these are called 'bits'. A byte is a
group of 8 bits, like this: 00110101. A computer word on my computer
('int') is 4 bytes, 32 bits: 10011010110101011010001010101011. Other
computers have different word sizes.

As you can see 32 ones and zeroes is a bit cumbersome to write down (or
even to read). Thus, conventionally people break the number down into
groups of 3 or 4 bits:

  1001.1010.1101.0101.1010.0010.1010.1011
  10.011.010.110.101.011.010.001.010.101.011 <-- note that the count of 3 starts on the right

These grouped sets of bits are then mapped onto digits, either four bits
per hexadecimal (base 16) digit or three bits per octal (base 8) digit.
Obviously, hexadecimal needs some new digits (since decimal digits only
go 0..9 and we need 6 more). These days, the letters 'A'..'F' are used
for the 'digits' that represent 10..15. Here's the map; the
correspondence is obvious:

    OCTAL:                   HEXADECIMAL:
  000 -> 0  100 -> 4       0000 -> 0  0100 -> 4  1000 -> 8  1100 -> C
  001 -> 1  101 -> 5       0001 -> 1  0101 -> 5  1001 -> 9  1101 -> D
  010 -> 2  110 -> 6       0010 -> 2  0110 -> 6  1010 -> A  1110 -> E
  011 -> 3  111 -> 7       0011 -> 3  0111 -> 7  1011 -> B  1111 -> f

So now we can write the hex and octal representations of those integers
above quite quickly along with their notations for C and other languages:

	1001.1010.1101.0101.1010.0010.1010.1011
    ->     9    A    D    5    A    2    A    B  --> 0x9AD5A2AB
				(that's 0x in front of the hex number)

and

	10.011.010.110.101.011.010.001.010.101.011 
         2   3   2   6   5   3   2   1   2   5   3 -> 023265321253
				(that's a numeric '0' in front)

Octal is easier to write down quickly, but hexadecimal has the nice
properties of breaking easily into bytes (which are pairs of digits).


        Operating on Binary Numbers in Programs

Sometimes it is handy to work with the bits stored in numbers rather
than just treating them as integers. Examples of such times include
remembering choices (each bit slot can be a 'yes'/'no' indicator),
keeping track of option flags (same idea, really, each bit slot is a
'yes'/'no' indicator for a flag's presence), or keeping track of a
number of small integers (e.g., successive pairs of bit slots can
remember numbers from 0..3). Of course, occasionally problems actually
contain 'bit strings'.

In C/C++ and others, assigning a binary number is easy if you know its
octal or hexadecimal representation:

	i = 0x9AD5A2AB;

or

	i = 023265321253;

More often, a set of single-bit values is combined to create an integer
of interest. One might think the statement below would do that:

	i = 0x10000 + 0x100;

and it will -- until the sign bit enters the picture or the same bit is
combined twice:

	i = 0x100 + 0x100;

In that case, a 'carry' occurs and then i contains 0x200 instead of
0x100 as probably desired. The 'or' operation -- denoted as '|' in C/C++
and others -- does the right thing. It combines successive bits using
these four rules:

	0|0 -> 0
        0|1 -> 1
        1|0 -> 1
        1|1 -> 1

The '|' operation is called 'bitwise or' in C so as not to be confused
with it's cousin '||' called 'logical or' or 'orif'. The '||' operator
evaluates the arithmetic value its left side and, if false (exactly 0),
evaluates its right side. If either evaluation is nonzero, then '||'
evaluates to true (exactly 1 in C).

It is the final rule that distinguishes the '|' operator from '+'.
Sometimes operators like this are displayed as a 'truth table':

         | | 0  1
        ---+------
         0 | 0  1
         1 | 1  1

It's easy to see that the 'bitwise or' operation is a way to set bits
inside an integer. A '1' results with either or both of the input bits
are '1'.

The easy way to query bits is using the 'logical and' (also known as
'andif') operator, denoted as '&' that has this truth table:

         & | 0  1
        ---+------
         0 | 0  0
         1 | 0  1

A '1' results only when *both* input bits are '1'. So, if one wants to
know if the 0x100 bit is '1' in an integer, the if statement is simple:

	if (a & 0x100) { printf("yes, 0x100 is on\n"); }

C/C++ (and others) contain additional operators, including 'exclusive
or' (denoted '^') with this truth table:

         ^ | 0  1
        ---+------
         0 | 0  1
         1 | 1  0

The 'exclusive or' operator is sometimes called 'xor', for easy of
typing. Xor yields a '1' either exactly *one* of its inputs is one:
either one or the other, but not both. This operator is very hand for
'toggling' (flipping) bits, changing them from '1' to '0' or vice-versa.
Consider this statement:

	a = a ^ 0x100;   /* same as a ^= 0x100; */

The 0x100 bit will be changed from 0->1 or 1->0, depending on its
current value.

Switching off a bit requires two operators. The new one is the unary
operator that toggles every bit in a word, creating what is called the
'bitwise complement' or just 'complement' of a word. Sometimes this is
called 'bit inversion' or just 'inversion' and is denoted by the tilde:
'~'. Here's a quick example:

	char a, b;	/* eight bits, not 32 */
	a = 0x4A;	/* 0100.1010 */
	b = ~a;		/* flip every bit: 1011.0101 */
	printf("b is 0x%X\n", b);

which yields something like:

	b is 0xB5

Thus, if we have a single bit switched on (e.g., 0x100) then ~0x100 has
all but one bit switched on: 0xFFFFFEFF (note the 'E' as the third
'digit' from the right).

These two operators combine to create a scheme for switching off bits:

	a = a & (~0x100);	/* swtch off the 0x100 bit */
				/* same as a &= ~0x100;

since all but one bit in ~0x100 is on, all the bits except the 0x100
bits appear in the result. Since the 0x100 bit is 'off' in ~0x100, that
bit is guaranteed to be '0' in the result. This operation is universally
called 'masking' as in 'mask off the 0x100 bit'.


        Summary

In summary, these operators enable setting, clearing, toggling, and
testing any bit or combination of bits in an integer:

		a |= 0x20;		/* turn on bit 0x20 */
		a &= ~0x20;		/* turn off bit 0x20 */
		a ^= 0x20;		/* toggle bit 0x20 */
		if (a & 0x20) {
			/* then the 0x20 bit is on */
		}
