*Prime Cryptarithm*

The following cryptarithm is a multiplication problem that can be solved
by substituting digits from a specified set of N digits into the
positions marked with *. If the set of prime digits {2,3,5,7} is
selected, the cryptarithm is called a PRIME CRYPTARITHM.

      * * *
   x    * *
    -------
      * * *         <-- partial product 1
    * * *           <-- partial product 2
    -------
    * * * *

Digits can appear only in places marked by `*'. Of course, leading
zeroes are not allowed.

Note that the 'partial products' are as taught in USA schools. The first
partial product is the product of the final digit of the second number
and the top number. The second partial product is the product of the
first digit of the second number and the top number.

Write a program that will find all solutions to the cryptarithm above
for any subset of digits from the set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.


      PROGRAM NAME: crypt1


      INPUT FORMAT

Line 1: 	N, the number of digits that will be used
Line 2: 	N space separated digits with which to solve the cryptarithm
